Usage
====

To use the RTC Pi library in your code you must first import the library:
```
var rtcpi = require('../../lib/rtcpi/rtcpi');
```

Next you must create an RTCPi object:

```
var rtc = new RTCPi();
```
Set the current time using a date object:
```
var d = new Date(2016, 07, 04, 10, 23, 00, 00);
rtc.setDate(d);
```
Enable the square-wave output at 8.192KHz on the SQW pin:
```
rtc.set_frequency(3)
rtc.enable_output()
```
Read the current date and time from the RTC at 1 second intervals:
```
var myClock = setInterval(clockTimer, 1000);

function clockTimer() {    
    console.log(rtc.readDate().toISOString());
}
```
